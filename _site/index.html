    <h1>Hi, I'm <span class="intro-callout">aly</span></h1>
<p>I'm a self-proclaimed UX unicorn. And although I do enjoy rainbows and sparkles,
  I have more than glitter to back it up. I have stellar frontend development skills including
  HTML5, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Django, and Git.
  On top of all that, I'm a fully-trained graphic designer who has spent years improving her UX skills.
  I have experience with persona mapping, wireframing, low-fi and hi-fi prototyping, and user testing.
  Whew!! That's a lot! I've had about 10 years to build up that skills list, and I'm proud
  to say that I'm continuing to add to it.</p>
<p>Want to know more about me? <a href="#">Let's chat!</a></p>
