		<h1>ABC Order Form</h1>
		<h2>An updated e-commerce solution</h2>
		<p>
			The <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/sunday-school/abc-2nd-edition/order/" target="_blank">Answers Bible Curriculum online order form</a> had major issues when it was handed to me. It was one giant table that
			took forever to scroll through, and by the time the customer reached the bottom, they forgot
			what they had filled in at the top. I did a complete overhaul of the ordering system with the customer's goals in mind.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first thing that needed to be addressed was mobile responsiveness. The old table didn't work at all on mobile,
			and over 50% of our traffic was from mobile devices. Next, I needed to find out how customers behaved when
			shopping for our products.
			ABC Customers order by age group, and tend to order in bulk. My solution made it much easier for them
			to shop by only showing them the age groups and lesson units they wanted to see. I also made it possible for them to add
			multiple SKUs to their cart at once, saving them time.
