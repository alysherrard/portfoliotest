			The <a href="https://myanswers.com/edu/" target="_blank">ABC Digital landing page</a> was originally created to market the new ABC Digital platform and to announce the open beta.
			I designed it so the content could easily be edited and transitioned to a standart marketing page when 1.0
			is released and subscriptions become available to purchase.
