			I'm not usually a product designer, but I had the opportunity to try my hand at apparel design
			recently. This design was created for a contest between all of the members of our company's
			in-house design team. A poll was published on social media, and the public voted for their favorite designs
			to be made into actual merch, and mine was one of the ones selected. You can find this shirt (and hoodie!)
			for sale at the Ark Encounter gift shop.
