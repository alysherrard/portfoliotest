		<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
		<h2>{{ page.subtitle }}</h2>
		<p>
			This design was one of the first projects I started for the DailyUI challenge.
			I liked the design direction of the sign-in page, so I decided to continue the theme
			on the payment flow. I plan to expand this design concept by animating the liquid background
			and working on the interaction design. This collection took approximately 2 hours to design.
