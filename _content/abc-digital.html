			I was fortunate to be the lead UX designer for
			<a href="https://myanswers.com/edu/" target="_blank">ABC Digital</a>, the latest software developed
			for the MyAnswers brand of digital products. Our amazing development team created a solution to import the printed Curriculum
			into a database. From there, I was responsible for creating the frontend solution from the ground up. My contributions included
			project management, UX research, refining the design system, wireframing, low-fi and hi-fi mockups, frontend development, and user acceptance testing.
